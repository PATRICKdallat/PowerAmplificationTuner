# PowerAmplifierTuner

ABSTRACT 
Live Sound Engineers have the role of tuning the PA system (Power Amplification System) before an event and this role is time-consuming especially for less experienced Sound Engineers. This project aims to produce a tool for Sound Engineers to help guide/direct them to the problematic areas of the acoustic profile of the venue, and advise the Sound Engineer how to take care of the problematic frequencies. This project is built from the ground up using C++ for fast and optimized functions to produce a system that analyses audio using self-built FFT functions in real-time. The Power Amplification Tuner system is Apple Macintosh based that creates a preset file for a Behringer x32 Mixing Console, with the additional use of any external Audio Interfaces (must be mac compatible).
